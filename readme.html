Page to view working prototype http://localhost/wordpress/test.

This is a first attempt of a working sortable list that you can also change the order with clicking the up and down arrows, the list order in recorded (see console) this new order then can be posted to a url endpoint.

I have left out the Font Awesome arrows up and down and replaced with words as I am having a problem getting them to display and would rather have something you can click on to see the function working.

Need to optimize code at some point and refactor

Design may need some tweaks as lots of CSS overrides in place, also could use webpack or gulp to optimize and if had more time would use SASS not CSS.

Thanks.
